>to write. 

>A nice thing to add is that if we think to the training of a neural network as the procedure of choosing among the various dynamical systems solving a task, a good one, we should aim to converge to structurally stable ones. In this way even if we converge to a local minimum, changes to the weights should not alter significantly the performance.

>another point of view could be that maybe naturally this is the choice of an optimiser, since it would mean convergin to a relatively flat area of the loss function (read if there are works about this)
