#### Additional material:
- My PhD Thesis where there is some more background and other constrained neural networks are discussed: [**PhD Thesis**](/phd_thesis.pdf)
- The lecture notes of a 16-hours course I thought at the University of Cambridge, where some of these topics are more extensively discussed: [**NOTES**](/graduateCourseNotes.pdf)
- Book chapter I collaborated on and which is strongly related with this course: [**Stable neural networks and connections to continuous dynamical systems**](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2510.22299).
