In this page I collect some brief notes about what I am reading and studying. These are by no means complete, and they are in continuous evolution. For this reason many notes have boxes like this

> do something ...

where I remind myself what would be nice to add to make the text more complete. These files are helpful for me to write down ideas and concepts. Furthermore, they are not meant to be read chronologically since they often are about different themes. The principle behind this section of my website is the one of a **[digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)** where everything is in evolution, and curated over time.

For this reason the proper way to read the notes in not prescribed, it is based on where the interest leads to.

Here are the notes I have written up to now:

- [Morse functions](/notes/morse-function)
- [Pseudo gradient vector fields](notes/pseudo-gradients)
